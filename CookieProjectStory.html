        <h1><strong>Our Story</strong></h1>
        <p>We are Summit School of the Poconos, which is a non-profit, project based, democratic, STEAM school, but you probable don't know what that means. First, project based means that we do projects. For example, we made toys out of parts. Next, democratic means that we vote on our rules. Finally, STEAM that means we are Science,Technology,Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics-based. Thank you for suporting the Summit School of the Poconos by buying the cookie dough we made. </p>
